# Widget Assets

## Avatar Image

Place your avatar image file here as `avatar-woman.png`.

The image should be:
- Square aspect ratio (recommended: 120x120px or larger)
- PNG format with transparency (or JPG)
- Clear, professional woman's face illustration
- Will be displayed in a 72px circular button

## Current Setup

The widget is configured to load the avatar from:
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rhysllwydlewis/JadeAssist@main/packages/widget/assets/avatar-woman.png
```

After placing your image here, commit it to the repository and the CDN link will automatically serve the updated image.
